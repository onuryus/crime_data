## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  Freeze Police ! ðŸ‘® 
In this repository you can found the code of one of my portfolio project, "Crime DashBoard at Chicago". The raw data got from "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudhanvahg/crimes-in-las-angeles/data". The raw data includes various crimes from 2020 to 2023, and the location and time of these crimes. However, the data for 2023 is not fully available.

You can find two different files in this project. The first is a jupyternotebook file to run on your local computer, and the second is the app.py code that is designed to publish the dashboard that I published on my portfolio site on pythonanywhere.com.
